# Foundry Script Scribbles

This repository holds Python Scripts I wrote for **The Foundry's Nuke and Hiero**.

They are meant to showcase some of the skills I have aquired over the last couple of years, from simple definitions to more advanced features. It is a fraction of the code I have written, since not all is eligible to be shared.

>*Disclaimer*  
>*Some scripts may not work outside their proper pipeline, especially since all the Hiero Scripts are originally used within the Shotgrid Desktop evironment. So don't be alarmed if it is not working for you.
>Thank you.*
